## Introduction

Machine Learning Toolkit is a GUI framework for implementing various machine learning algorithms for prediction. It supports common regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms. This project is written in Python language and PyQt5 framework, and has the following main features:

## Main Features

- **Import Data**: Users can import their own data into the GUI for processing.

- **Normalization**: Users can choose whether to normalize the input data and provide multiple common data normalization methods for selection.

- **Data Split**: Users can set the data split ratio of the training set and the independent test set, and set whether to randomize the data before splitting the training set/test set and set a random seed to ensure the repeatability of each split.

- **Select Algorithm**: Choose different machine learning algorithms according to project requirements, including regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms.

- **Modify Hyperparameters**: Users can modify the hyperparameters of the machine learning model to achieve better prediction results.

- **Cross-validation**: Users can choose whether to perform cross-validation and provide multiple cross-validation methods, such as K-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out cross-validation, leave-P-out cross-validation, and stratified cross-validation.

- **CPU Cores**: Users can set the number of CPU cores used when training the model.

- **Save Model**: Users can choose whether to save the trained machine learning model.

- **Predictive Result Analysis**: Users can preview the predictive result data of the trained machine learning model and various common predictive score indicators, and perform various visualization and analysis of the predictive result.

This project aims to provide a powerful tool for machine learning beginners and professionals to help them quickly and easily implement machine learning models and analyze and optimize model performance.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

- For Python package dependencies, please refer to the requirements.txt file
